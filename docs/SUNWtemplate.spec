############################################################################
# The example in this template builds 2 GNOME components, gnome-foo and
# libgnomebar and packages them together into a Solaris package called
# SUNWgnome-foo-bar that is split by file system boundaries [Solaris rule],
# so it has a "subpackage" called SUNWgnome-foo-bar-root.
# gnome-foo.spec and libgnomebar.spec are the JDS linux spec files for
# the corresponding RPMs.
# 
# See SUNWtemplate-standalone.spec for an example where Linux spec files 
# are not used

%include Solaris.inc
# The Solaris.inc file sets up some defaults: compiler options,
# default locations and extra info needed for building Solaris pkgs.
# See the file itself for more details, it's located in this directory.
# Note that this line should appear before any %use lines so that 
# macros in Solaris.inc are used by the %use'd spec files

%use gfoo = gnome-foo.spec
%use libgnomebar = libgnomebar.spec
# Declare that this spec file will use information (tags, scriptlets, etc.)
# from another spec file or files. Assign a name (gfoo/libgnomebar) to the
# spec file for future reference.
# In this case gnome-foo

Name:                    SUNWgnome-foo-bar
# This is the name (PKG) of the Solaris package.

Summary:                 GNOME foo bar libraries
# This will become the one-line description of the Solaris package

Version:                 %{default_pkg_version}
# This is the version of the Solaris package that has little to do with
# the version of the gnome components included, since several gnome
# components may be packaged together.
# In case of non-GNOME components, however, we prefer to use the
# tarball version number of the component.
# Note: package version numbers must be numeric.  Things like 1.0.5beta
# and v6b are not allowed
#  %{default_pkg_version} is defined in Solaris.inc.

SUNW_BaseDir:            %{_basedir}
# The base directory of the Solaris package (normally /usr, / or
# /opt/<product>)
# You need to define the basedir for each package and subpackage.
# For now, the basedir of "-root" packages should be /, everything
# else it should be %{_basedir} (defined in Solaris.inc)

SUNW_Copyright:          %{name}.copyright
# Use the copyright-extractor script to create a copyright file.

BuildRoot:               %{_tmppath}/%{name}-%{version}-build
# Same as with linux specs. Note that in this case this will be
# /var/tmp/SUNWgnome-foo-bar-2.6.0-build

%include default-depend.inc
# There's a list of packages that all GNOME packages depend on
# These are really just the Solaris core, devices, system libs.
# We could include them in all spec files but it's nicer and shorter
# to %include them from a common file.

Requires: SUNWxwrtl
Requires: SUNWxwplt
Requires: SUNWlibms
Requires: SUNWlxml
Requires: SUNWpng
Requires: SUNWTiff
Requires: SUNWjpg
# These are the additional [to the default ones %include'd above]
# dependencies of this package. Please don't use version checks in
# Solaris dependencies. They are not usually used and not properly
# implemented in the build scripts either.
# Try to identify the dependencies of the package the best you can.
# Missing dependencies may cause broken installs, but unnecessary deps
# are a pain too.

BuildRequires: SUNWsfwhea
# These lines define what package need to be installed at build time.

%package root
Summary:                 %{summary} - / filesystem
SUNW_BaseDir:            /
%include default-depend.inc
# This defines the "-root" subpackage, i.e. SUNWgnome-foo-bar-root.
# Solaris packages must be split by usual filesystem boundaries, so
# root filesystem (e.g. /etc) files must be separated from the rest of
# the package.  According to Solaris packaging rules, development and
# runtime files must also be separated..
#
# The naming convention used in GNOME is this:
#
## runtime pkgs:
#
# SUNWgnome-package-name:             the main package, binaries, libs,
#                                     files in %{_datadir} needed at runtime
# SUNWgnome-package-name-root:        /etc, /var stuff
#
## development pkgs:
#
# SUNWgnome-package-name-devel:       header files, pkgconfig files,
#                                     binaries only needed for development,
#                                     developer docs, man pages, aclocal
#                                     macros, etc.
# SUNWgnome-package-name-devel-root:  any root files that are only needed
#                                     for development (rarely needed)

%changelog
* Fri Jun  2 2006 - laca@sun.com
- update to remove info about -share pkgs and add some more comments
* Fri Feb 27 2004 - laszlo.peter@sun.com
- add info about %changelog to the template
# Although pkgbuild doesn't currently do anything with %changelog, it's
# still a good idea to use changelog entries.

# To build a Solaris package from this spec file, copy all referenced
# spec files and include files to %topdir/SPECS, copy all sources & patches
# referenced in this or any of the %use'd spec files to %topdir/SOURCES
# and run pkgbuild -ba <this spec file>
# Alternatively, run
#       pkgtool build <spec-file>
# in this directory.
