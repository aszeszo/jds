Spec file extensions quick reference.
------------------------------------

Solaris specific tags:

    SUNW_BaseDir prefix
        Define prefix as the value of the BASEDIR tag in the SVr4 package.
        prefix will be stripped off the beginning of all path names in the
        %files section, therefore it has to be a real prefix, otherwise it
	will abort with an error.

    SUNW_ProdName name
        SUNW_PRODNAME tag in the Solaris pkg.
    SUNW_ProdVers version
        SUNW_PRODVERS tag in the Solaris pkg.
    SUNW_Category cat
        CATEGORY tag in the Solaris pkg.
    SUNW_HotLine text
        HOTLINE tag in the pkginfo file of the SVr4 package. 
    SUNW_MaxInst num
        num is the value of the MAXINST tag (maximum number of
        instances of the pkg allowed to be installed on a system) in
        the pkginfo file of the SVr4 package. 

    SUNW_Copyright file
        Define file as the name of the file that contains the copyright
	information for the package.


Special macros:

%include <file>

	 process the contents of %topdir/SPECS/<file> as if they were
	 copied into this file

%use <name> = <spec-file>

	 Declare that parts of %topdir/SPECS/<spec-file> will be referenced
	 later in this spec file and call it <name>.
	 Any macros %define'd before the %use line will also affect
	 <spec-file> (as if they were copied to the beginning of that file).
	 E.g. %use gtk = gtk2.spec

%<name>.<def>	   or
%{<name>.<def>}

	 Reference to a %define'd macro in the spec file called <name>,
	 as defined by a preceding %use. Gets replaced by the value
	 of the referenced macro.
	 E.g. %{gtk._datadir}

%<name>.<tag>	   or
%{<name>.<tag>}

	 Reference to the value of a <tag> in the spec file called <name>.
	 Gets replaced by the value of <tag>.
	 E.g. %{gtk.version}

%<name>.<scriptlet> [-d <directory>]	   or
%{<name>.<scriptlet>} [-d <directory>]

	 Execute <scriptlet> from the spec file named <name>. If -d <directory>
	 is used, cd into <directory> before executing the <scriptlet>.
	 E.g. %gtk.prep

%<name>.<package>.<tag>	    or
%{<name.<package>.<tag>}

	 Reference to the value of a <tag> in a <package> (subpackage)
	 in the <name>'d spec file.
	 E.g. %{gtk.gtk-devel.summary}
	 Note that is not properly tested yet, use with caution and
	 let me know if it's broken.
