For the avoidance of doubt, except that if any license choice other
than GPL or LGPL is available it will apply instead, Sun elects to
use only the General Public License version 2 (GPLv2) at this time
for any software where a choice of GPL license versions is made
available with the language indicating that GPLv2 or any later
version may be used, or where a choice of which version of the GPL
is applied is otherwise unspecified.

Afin d'écarter le moindre doute, à moins qu'un choix de licence autre que
la GPL ou LGPL ne soit proposé et donc appliqué à sa place, Sun a décidé,
pour le moment, d'utiliser uniquement la General Public License version 2 (GPLv2)
pour tout logiciel où le choix de versions de licences GPL s'accompagne d'une mention
indiquant que la GPLv2 ou toute version ultérieure peut être utilisée, ou pour tout
logiciel où le choix de version de la GPL à appliquer n'est spécifié en aucune manière.
