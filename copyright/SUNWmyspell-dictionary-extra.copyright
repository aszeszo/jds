                     Version 2, June 1991

      59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
  
                            Preamble
  
    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General
  Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share
  and change free software--to make sure the software is free for
  all its users.  This General Public License applies to most of
  the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other
  program whose authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free
  Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library
  General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to your
  programs, too.
  
    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,
  not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make
  sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free
  software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you
  receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can
  change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs;
  and that you know you can do these things.
  
    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that
  forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to
  surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain
  responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
  software, or if you modify it.
  
    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program,
  whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all
  the rights that you have.  You must make sure that they, too,
  receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them
  these terms so they know their rights.
  
    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the
  software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.
  
    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make
  certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for
  this free software.  If the software is modified by someone
  else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what
  they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced
  by others will not reflect on the original authors'
  reputations.
  
    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
  patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a
  free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in
  effect making the program proprietary.  To prevent this, we
  have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for
  everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
  
    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.
  
                   GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING,
                  DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  
    0. This License applies to any program or other work which
  contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may
  be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.
  The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a
  "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
  derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
  containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or
  with modifications and/or translated into another language.
  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the
  term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
  
    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification
  are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.
  The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the
  output from the Program is covered only if its contents
  constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having
  been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends
  on what the Program does.
  
    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the
  Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium,
  provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on
  each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of
  warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
  License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
  recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the
  Program.
  
    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
  copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
  exchange for a fee.
  
    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any
  portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and
  copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms
  of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these
  conditions:
      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent
  notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any
  change.
      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,
  that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the
  Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no
  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
      c) If the modified program normally reads commands
  interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running
  for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or
  display an announcement including an appropriate copyright
  notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying
  that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
  the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
  view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself
  is interactive but does not normally print such an
  announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to
  print an announcement.)
  
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
  Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and
  separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,
  do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
  separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as
  part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the
  distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,
  whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
  whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
  it.
  
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
  contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather,
  the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution
  of derivative or collective works based on the Program.
  
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
  Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program)
  on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
  the other work under the scope of this License.
  
    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on
  it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under
  the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do
  one of the following:
      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding
  machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under
  the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily
  used for software interchange;
  or,
      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least
  three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than
  your cost of physically performing source distribution, a
  complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source
  code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
  above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
  or,
      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the
  offer to distribute corresponding source code.  (This
  alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and
  only if you received the program in object code or executable
  form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
  
    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the
  work for making modifications to it.  For an executable work,
  complete source code means all the source code for all modules
  it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,
  plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
  of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source
  code distributed need not include anything that is normally
  distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating
  system on which the executable runs, unless that component
  itself accompanies the executable.
  
    If distribution of executable or object code is made by
  offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering
  equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place
  counts as distribution of the source code, even though third
  parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
  object code.
  
    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
  Program except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the
  Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
  under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
  or rights, from you under this License will not have their
  licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
  compliance.
  
    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have
  not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to
  modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works.
  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this
  License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program
  (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your
  acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and
  conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program
  or works based on it.
  
    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based
  on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license
  from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the
  Program subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not
  impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of
  the rights granted herein.
  
    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
  parties to this License.
  
    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of
  patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to
  patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court
  order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions
  of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of
  this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
  simultaneously your obligations under this License and any
  other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
  distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the
  Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly
  through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and
  this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of
  the Program.
  
    If any portion of this section is held invalid or
  unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of
  the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is
  intended to apply in other circumstances.
  
    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to
  infringe any patents or other property right claims or to
  contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole
  purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
  distribution system, which is implemented by public license
  practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the
  wide range of software distributed through that system in
  reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
  the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
  distribute software through any other system and a licensee
  cannot impose that choice.
  
    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is
  believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
  
    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted
  in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted
  interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the
  Program under this License may add an explicit geographical
  distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
  distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
  excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the
  limitation as if written in the body of this License.
  
    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
  new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
  
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
  Program specifies a version number of this License which
  applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of
  following the terms and conditions either of that version or of
  any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
  If the Program does not specify a version number of this
  License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
  Software Foundation.
  
    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other
  free programs whose distribution conditions are different,
  write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which
  is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the
  Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for
  this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
  preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
  software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software
  generally.
  
                         NO WARRANTY
  
    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS
  NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
  APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
  COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS
  IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
  INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE
  ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS
  WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE
  COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  
    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO
  IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO
  MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE,
  BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
  INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
  INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS
  OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED
  BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE
  WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY
  HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
  
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  
    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
  
    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the
  greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve
  this is to make it free software which everyone can
  redistribute and change under these terms.
  
    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is
  safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
  effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file
  should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to
  where the full notice is found.
  
      <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of
  what it does.>
      Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>
  
      This program is free software; you can redistribute it
  and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public
  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
  version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later
  version.
  
      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be
  useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied
  warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.
  
      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public
  License along with this program; if not, write to the Free
  Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston,
  MA  02111-1307  USA
  
  
    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and
  paper mail.
  
    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice
  like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
  
      Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
  
      Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
  type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome 
  toredistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for 
  details.
  
    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show
  the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of
  course, the commands you use may be called something other than
  `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu
  items--whatever suits your program.
  
    You should also get your employer (if you work as a
  programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright
  disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  Here is a sample;
  alter the names:
  
    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written
  by James Hacker.
  
    <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
    Ty Coon, President of Vice
  
    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
  program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a
  subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit
  linking proprietary applications with the library.  If this is
  what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License
  instead of this License.

    Това е пакет за проверка на правописа за OpenOffice.org. Може
  да свалите OpenOffice.org от http://openoffice.org/.
    Пакетът е продукт на проекта bgOffice. За повече
  информация, прочетете файла README.bgOffice, който идва с
  този пакет или посетете страницата на проекта на адрес:
  http://bgoffice.sourceforge.net.
  
  
                Указания за инсталиране и настройка
  
  
  1. Копирате файловете bg_BG.dic и bg_BG.aff в директорията:
  
    ..\OpenOffice.org\share\dict\ooo
  
    Ако сте инсталирали проверка на правописа на американски
  английски, то в тази директория трябва да се намират файловете
  en_US.aff, en_US.dic и dictionary.lst.
  
  
  2. Отваряте файла dictionary.lst с текстов редактор и добавяте
  следния ред на края му:
  
    DICT bg BG bg_BG
  
  
  3. Стартирате OpenOffice и осъществявате следните настройки:
  - Избирате от менюто Tools/Options;
  - От менюто вляво на изскочилото диалогово прозорче избирате
    Language Settings/Writing Aids;
  - От диалога вдясно избирате
    Available language modules/OpenOffice MySpell SpellChecker;
  - Включвате опцията (ако не е включена);
  - Избирате бутона Edit вдясно от тази опция;
  - Избирате Language - Bulgarian;
  - В полето долу избирате Spelling/OpenOffice MySpell
    SpellChecker и включвате опцията;
  - Избирате бутона Close (за да затворите този диалогов
    прозорец);
  - Натискате бутона OK (за да потвърдите настройките).
  
  
  4. Ако текущият избран език не е български, то трябва да
  изпълните следните стъпки за да го изберете:
  - Избирате от менюто Tools/Options;
  - От менюто вляво на изскочилото диалогово прозорче избирате
    Language Settings/Languages;
  - Сега от същия диалог, но вдясно избирате
    Default languages for documents/Western/Bulgarian;
  - В този момент пред българския език (Bulgarian) трябва да
    виждате знака за проверка на правописа (малка икона с отметка
    на фона на буквите ABC). Това означава, че новите настройки са
    възприети;
  - Натискате бутона OK (за да потвърдите промените).
  
  
  5. В този момент проверката на правописа трябва да функционира.
  Ако имате проблеми, опитайте се да ги разрешите и да ми пишете.

                        ОБЩА ИНФОРМАЦИЯ
  
  
    Този проект има за цел да създаде база с думи за проверка на
  правописа, проверка за съгласуване на частите на речта
  (проверка на граматиката) и сричкопренасяне. Идеята е да се
  направят пакети за поддръжка на българския език за продукти с
  отворен код като OpenOffice.org, aspell, ispell и други.
  
  
    Системата е основана изцяло на книгата/учебника на Кръстев Б.,
  Морфология на българския език в 187 типови таблици. С., НИ,
  1984. Много интересно и полезно четиво. Първоначално идеята
  беше да се създаде проверка на правописа. Имаше събрани
  достатъчно думи, но липсваха правилата за образуване на
  словоформите. След намирането на тази книга, количествените
  натрупвания преминаха в качествени и тогава се промени изцяло
  формата и структурата на данните за да отговарят на тези 187
  типа. Промениха се и идеята, и стратегията за развитие на
  проверката на правописа. Информацията, която сега се съдържа
  във файловете, дава възможност за осъществяване на много повече
  цели освен проверка на правописа. Сравнително лесно може да се
  направи система за проверка на съгласуването на частите на
  речта. Не е трудно да се направи програма за разпознаване на
  думите и определяне на техния тип, лице, числото и дали (не) са
  членувани. Но това са бъдещи планове.
  
  
    Думите идват главно от две места. Първата партида (около 30
  000 думи) идват от "SA Dictionary" (http://sa.dir.bg/) и от "O2
  Dictionary" (известен преди като "Otto Dictionary",
  http://get.to/otto). След това бяха добавени около 20 000 нови
  думи от http://dabuzzard.250free.com/, по-точно от
  http://dabuzzard.250free.com/enbg.zip. Има списък на още около
  30 000 думи в различни форми, които трябва да бъдат проверени и
  класифицирани. От тях може да излязат още около 5 000 - 10 000
  думи в основна форма. Но по-важната задача е да се прегледат
  наличните думи за грешки. Българските имена и фамилии са
  събирани от разни списъци в Интернет. Главно от страниците на
  комисията за изборите, където са публикувани всички кандидат
  депутати и от разни други места, където има списъци с имена на
  хора. Имената на градовете и държавите са събирани от разни
  правителствени страници в Интернет, където има примерно списък
  на страните, с които имаме не знам си каква спогодба.
  
  
    Към системата има няколко скрипта на Perl, с чиято помощ се
  извършва проверка на системата, добавяне на нови думи и
  генерирана на речници за OpenOffice.org, aspell и ispell.
  Най-добре да използвате системата под Linux (понеже голяма част
  от командите, които използвам ги няма под Windows). Ако някой
  иска да ползва системата за генериране на речници или добавяне
  на нови думи под Windows, трябва да си инсталира Perl и Cygwin.
  Но тогава Windows-a ще заприлича на Linux, та затова направо си
  инсталирайте Linux и забравете за Windows.
  
  
    Ако желаете само да добавяте нови думи и да генерирате
  речниците, то прочетете кратките обяснения в стил "Как да?".
  
  
    Ако някой мисли да се занимава с разширяване на системата,
  добре е да прочете спецификацията й. Там има няколко файла,
  които описват структурата на директориите, типовете и файловете
  с данни. Има подробно обяснение на структурата на директориите
  и правилата за дефиниране и създаване на типове и подтипове.
  Описан е и процесът на обхождане на тези типове (файлове) и
  начина на генериране на последователни имена. Има и подробна
  спецификация за вътрешната структура на файловете (формата на
  данните). Описани са правилата за обработка на файл. Описан е
  начинът за образуване на словоформи от основната форма.
  
  
    Всяка помощ е добра дошла. Търсят се доброволци да помагат.

  Diccionari MySpell 0.1
  ----------------------
  
  L'objectiu d'aquest projecte йs crear un corrector ortogrаfic multiplataforma de lliure distribuciу que es pugui fer servir en tots els programes que s'estan traduint al catalа. L'idea es crear un lиxic i unes regles ortogrаfiques i realitzar versions de les mateixes per iSpell, MySpell, AsPell. S'han tingut molt en compte les diferents variants dialectals, especialment el valenciа i el balear.
  
  L'ъnica versiу d'un corrector en catalа d'aquesta mena que coneixem йs l'Ispell d'en Ignasi Labastida que podeu trobar aquн. Durant molt anys ha estat la peзa en catalа de referиncia en aquesta аrea, des de Softcatalа hem decidit comenзar de nou en quelcom mйs sofisticat i elaborat. La feina de l'Ignasi ens ha servit per afinar i constrastar la nostra feina.
  
  Que s'ha fet
  ------------
  
  Bй, s'ha creat un lиxic i les corresponents regles perquи el diccionari pugui declinar les paraules correctament. Actualment el diccionari funciona bй perт hi ha encara problemes que s'han de corregir. Si vols conиixer amb mйs detall el seu estat baixa-te'l.
  
  Coses pedents
  -------------
  
  Provar el corrector per detectar-ne els errors. Els primers que poden inaugurar la llista:
  
  - Falten plurals i femenins (p.e ell/ella/ells/elles). S'haurien de provar  sobretot els pronoms.
  - Hi ha paraules no admeten la preposiciу de (p.e d'on). Crec que sуn  sobretot adverbis i pronoms.
  - Es considera incorrecte "Йs" (en majъscules). .
  - Si s'accepta una proposta amb un apтstrof, OpenOffice no el canvia per un  apтstrof tipogrаfic. Sospit que aixт no es pot arreglar des de MySpell, perт s'hauria d'investigar mйs
  - Els suggeriments no tenen gaire qualitat, ja que no es comenзa pels  errors mйs habituals, ni es proposen paraules a mйs d'una letra de  distаncia. Crec que tenc un pla que pot marxar per arreglar les dues coses alhora.

  NOTAS de ACTIVACION
  ===================
  Hay una problema en la manera de activar la diccionario de Catalan.
  Aqui, una copia del comunicaciуn respecto al problema:
  
   Hola Richard:
   Esta soluciуn que me has dado ha funcionado ya que ahora corrige en
   catalбn. Es una soluciуn temporal, pero lo importante es que se pueda 
   utilizar el diccionario.
   Juan Josй
  
   Richard Holt escribiу:
  
   ...
   >>del todo lo podrнa solucionar. Te agradezco el interйs. Verбs aquн en
  
   >>Barcelona nadie querrб usar el OpenOffice a no ser que sea capaz de 
   >>corregir el catalбn y me interesa como alternativa al Word en el
   >>colegio donde trabajo.
   >>
   >>
   >
   >Hola Juan,
   >
   >Yo se que recibiste la respuesta de Kevin y que ya Tomas, quien esta
   >manteniendo la diccionario, estan buscando una solucion. 
   >
   >Aqui una traduccion en mi espanglish (no se como esta su ingles pero
   >quizбs sera util):
   >
   >Escoje una idioma que no esta usando, asignarlo en dictionary.lst:
   >
   >DICT es CO ca_ES
   >
   >para prestar lo de Colombia pero se ve mбs cerca de Catalan, mбs o
   >menos. 
   >
   >Este quiere decir que ahora, Catalan van a parecer como Espaсol
   >(Colombia), y tienes que fijar la idioma en que trabajas a Colombia,
   >pero segun lo funciona. No es muy elegante pero pronto consigas una
   >verdadero. 
   >
   >"The only workaround is to assign the Catalan dictionary to some
  liitle used  locale and set your language appropriately to actually
  spellcheck  something."
  
  saludos,
  Richard.

  		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  		       Version 2, June 1991
  
   Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                         59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
  
  			    Preamble
  
    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
  License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
  software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
  General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
  Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
  using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
  the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
  your programs, too.
  
    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
  price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
  
    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
  distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
  
    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
  you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
  source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
  rights.
  
    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
  (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
  distribute and/or modify the software.
  
    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
  software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
  that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
  authors' reputations.
  
    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
  patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
  program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
  program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
  patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
  
    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.
  
  		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  
    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
  a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
  under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
  refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
  means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
  that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
  either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
  language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
  the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
  
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
  running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
  is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
  Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
  
    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
  source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
  notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
  and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
  along with the Program.
  
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
  you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
  
    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
  
      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
  
      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
      whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
      part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
      parties under the terms of this License.
  
      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
      when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
      interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
      announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
      notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
      a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
      these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
      License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
      does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
      the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
  
  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
  on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
  
  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
  collective works based on the Program.
  
  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
  with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.
  
    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
  under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
  
      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
      source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
      1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
  
      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
      years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
      cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
      machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
      distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
      customarily used for software interchange; or,
  
      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
      to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
      allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
      received the program in object code or executable form with such
      an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
  
  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
  code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
  associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
  control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
  special exception, the source code distributed need not include
  anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
  form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
  operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
  itself accompanies the executable.
  
  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
  access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
  access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
  distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
  
    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
  except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
  void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
  this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
  parties remain in full compliance.
  
    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
  Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
  the Program or works based on it.
  
    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
  Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
  these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
  this License.
  
    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
  may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
  
  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
  apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
  circumstances.
  
  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
  integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
  implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
  impose that choice.
  
  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.
  
    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
  original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
  those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
  countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
  
    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
  of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
  address new problems or concerns.
  
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
  later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
  either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
  Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
  this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
  Foundation.
  
    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
  to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
  Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
  make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
  of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
  of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
  
  			    NO WARRANTY
  
    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
  FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
  OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
  PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
  TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
  PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  
    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
  REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
  INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
  OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
  TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
  PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
  
  		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  
  	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
  
    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
  free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
  
    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
  the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
  
      <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
      Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
  
      This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
      it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
      the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
      (at your option) any later version.
  
      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
      GNU General Public License for more details.
  
      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
      along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
      Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
  
  
  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
  
  If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
  when it starts in an interactive mode:
  
      Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
      Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
      This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
      under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
  
  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
  parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
  be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
  mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
  
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
  school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
  necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
  
    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
    `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
  
    <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
    Ty Coon, President of Vice
  
  This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
  proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
  consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
  library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
  Public License instead of this License.

  The Comprehensive Danish Dictionary (DSDO) is a free spell-checking dictionary
  for Danish published by Skеne Sjжlland Linux User Group (SSLUG).  One thing
  which makes this dictionary different from most other dictionaries is that it
  basically is the result of a vote among the proof-readers.  The editorial
  group has _not_ proof-read all the words in the dictionary, but guides the
  proof-readers and keeps track of the overall status of the dictionary.

  This variation copes correctly with fully capitalized greek words. Penalty
  for this, is the increase of proposed words and bigger vocab size.
  This dictionary is based on greek wordlist and affixes used by ispell 
  (which based on older work of Mitalas and Seraskeris). Many thanks to 
  Voula Sanida (voulariba@source.gr) and Panayotis Vryonis (vrypan@yassou.net) 
  for their help in converting the affix rules and to all the people that
  contributed words to the vocabulary.

  		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  		       Version 2, June 1991
  
   Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                         59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
  
  			    Preamble
  
    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
  License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
  software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
  General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
  Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
  using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
  the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
  your programs, too.
  
    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
  price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
  
    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
  distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
  
    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
  you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
  source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
  rights.
  
    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
  (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
  distribute and/or modify the software.
  
    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
  software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
  that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
  authors' reputations.
  
    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
  patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
  program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
  program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
  patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
  
    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.
  
  		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  
    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
  a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
  under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
  refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
  means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
  that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
  either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
  language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
  the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
  
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
  running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
  is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
  Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
  
    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
  source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
  notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
  and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
  along with the Program.
  
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
  you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
  
    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
  
      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
  
      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
      whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
      part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
      parties under the terms of this License.
  
      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
      when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
      interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
      announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
      notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
      a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
      these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
      License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
      does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
      the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
  
  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
  on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
  
  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
  collective works based on the Program.
  
  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
  with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.
  
    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
  under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
  
      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
      source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
      1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
  
      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
      years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
      cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
      machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
      distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
      customarily used for software interchange; or,
  
      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
      to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
      allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
      received the program in object code or executable form with such
      an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
  
  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
  code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
  associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
  control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
  special exception, the source code distributed need not include
  anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
  form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
  operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
  itself accompanies the executable.
  
  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
  access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
  access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
  distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
  
    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
  except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
  void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
  this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
  parties remain in full compliance.
  
    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
  Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
  the Program or works based on it.
  
    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
  Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
  these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
  this License.
  
    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
  may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
  
  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
  apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
  circumstances.
  
  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
  integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
  implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
  impose that choice.
  
  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.
  
    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
  original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
  those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
  countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
  
    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
  of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
  address new problems or concerns.
  
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
  later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
  either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
  Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
  this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
  Foundation.
  
    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
  to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
  Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
  make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
  of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
  of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
  
  			    NO WARRANTY
  
    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
  FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
  OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
  PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
  TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
  PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  
    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
  REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
  INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
  OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
  TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
  PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
  
  		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  
  	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
  
    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
  free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
  
    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
  the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
  
      <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
      Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>
  
      This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
      it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
      the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
      (at your option) any later version.
  
      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
      GNU General Public License for more details.
  
      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
      along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
      Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
  
  
  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
  
  If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
  when it starts in an interactive mode:
  
      Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
      Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
      This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
      under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
  
  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
  parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
  be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
  mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
  
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
  school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
  necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
  
    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
    `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
  
    <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
    Ty Coon, President of Vice
  
  This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
  proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
  consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
  library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
  Public License instead of this License.

  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the
  version number 2.1.]
  
  Preamble
  
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
  share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are 
  intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to 
  make sure the software is free for all its users.
  
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially
  designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software 
  Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but 
  we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the 
  ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any 
  particular case, based on the explanations below.
  
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, 
  not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that 
  you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge 
  for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get 
  it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of 
  it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do 
  these things.
  
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid 
  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these 
  rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for 
  you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
  
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or 
  for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. 
  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. 
  If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object 
  files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library 
  after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show 
  them these terms so they know their rights.
  
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the 
  library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal 
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
  
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is 
  no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by 
  someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have 
  is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will 
  not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.
  
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any 
  free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively 
  restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license 
  from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license 
  obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full 
  freedom of use specified in this license.
  
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary 
  GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public 
  License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different 
  from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain 
  libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.
  
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a 
  shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined 
  work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public 
  License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits 
  its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more 
  lax criteria for linking other code with the library.
  
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does 
  Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public 
  License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an 
  advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the 
  reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. 
  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special 
  circumstances.
  
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage 
  the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a 
  de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed 
  to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the 
  same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little 
  to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the 
  Lesser General Public License.
  
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free 
  programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free 
  software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free 
  programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, 
  as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.
  
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' 
  freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the 
  Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a 
  modified version of the Library.
  
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
  follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the 
  library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code 
  derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the 
  library in order to run.
  
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program 
  which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized 
  party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General 
  Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as 
  "you".
  
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared 
  so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some 
  of those functions and data) to form executables.
  
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which 
  has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" 
  means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: 
  that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either 
  verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into 
  another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without 
  limitation in the term "modification".)
  
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
  modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the 
  source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface 
  definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and 
  installation of the library.
  
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not 
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running 
  a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a 
  program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the 
  Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). 
  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the 
  program that uses the Library does.
  
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete 
  source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you 
  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate 
  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices 
  that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and 
  distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.
  
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and 
  you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
  
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, 
  thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such 
  modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that 
  you also meet all of these conditions:
  
      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
  
      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices 
         stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
  
      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge 
         to all third parties under the terms of this License.
  
      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a 
  table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the 
  facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, 
  then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an 
  application does not supply such function or table, the facility still 
  operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.
  
      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a 
  purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. 
  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function 
  or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does 
  not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)
  
      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If 
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and 
  can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, 
  then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you 
  distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same 
  sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the 
  distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose 
  permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to 
  each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
  
      Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest 
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to 
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective 
  works based on the Library.
  
      In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library 
  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a 
  storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the 
  scope of this License. 
  
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public 
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do 
  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that 
  they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead 
  of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary 
  GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version 
  instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.
  
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that 
  copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent 
  copies and derivative works made from that copy.
  
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the 
  Library into a program that is not a library.
  
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of 
  it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of 
  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete 
  corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed 
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for 
  software interchange.
  
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a 
  designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code 
  from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source 
  code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along 
  with the object code.
  
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, 
  but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with 
  it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, 
  is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the 
  scope of this License.
  
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates 
  an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains 
  portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". 
  The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states 
  terms for distribution of such executables.
  
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that 
  is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative 
  work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is 
  true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the 
  Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be 
  true is not precisely defined by law.
  
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure 
  layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten 
  lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, 
  regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables 
  containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall 
  under Section 6.)
  
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute 
  the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables 
  containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are 
  linked directly with the Library itself.
  
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a 
  "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing 
  portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your 
  choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the 
  customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such 
  modifications.
  
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library 
  is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this 
  License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during 
  execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright 
  notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the 
  user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:
  
      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable 
  source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the 
  work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the 
  work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete 
  machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source 
  code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a 
  modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that 
  the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will 
  not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified 
  definitions.)
  
      b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. 
  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library 
  already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library 
  functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a 
  modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the 
  modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work 
  was made with.
  
      c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three 
  years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, 
  above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.
  
      d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from 
  a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified 
  materials from the same place.
  
      e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials 
  or that you have already sent this user a copy.
  
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" 
  must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the 
  executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be 
  distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in 
  either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, 
  kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, 
  unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
  
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions 
  of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the 
  operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and 
  the Library together in an executable that you distribute.
  
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library 
  side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities 
  not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, 
  provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library 
  and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided 
  that you do these two things:
  
      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based 
  on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must 
  be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
  
      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that 
  part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find 
  the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
  
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the 
  Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt 
  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
  Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under 
  this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, 
  from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so 
  long as such parties remain in full compliance.
  
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed 
  it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute 
  the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law 
  if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or 
  distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate 
  your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions 
  for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.
  
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the 
  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the 
  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library 
  subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further 
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. 
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with 
  this License.
  
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not 
  excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute 
  so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and 
  any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not 
  distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not 
  permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive 
  copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could 
  satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from 
  distribution of the Library.
  
  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any 
  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, 
  and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
  
  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any 
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such 
  claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of 
  the free software distribution system which is implemented by public 
  license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the
   wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on 
  consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to 
  decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other 
  system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
  
  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be 
  a consequence of the rest of this License.
  
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in 
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, 
  the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License 
  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those 
  countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries 
  not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation 
  as if written in the body of this License.
  
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions 
  of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions 
  will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail 
  to address new problems or concerns.
  
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library 
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any 
  later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions 
  either of that version or of any later version published by the Free 
  Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version 
  number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software 
  Foundation.
  
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free 
  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, 
  write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is 
  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software 
  Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be 
  guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives 
  of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software 
  generally.
  
  NO WARRANTY
  
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY 
  FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN 
  OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES 
  PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED 
  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS 
  TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE 
  LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, 
  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING 
  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR 
  REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, 
  INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES 
  ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT 
  LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES 
  SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE 
  WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN 
  ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  
  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest 
  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that 
  everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting 
  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of 
  the ordinary General Public License).
  
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is 
  safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively 
  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the 
  "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
  
      <one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.> 
  Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
  
      This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify 
  it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published 
  by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or 
  (at your option) any later version.
  
      This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but 
  WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY 
  or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public 
  License for more details.
  
      You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public 
  License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software 
  Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA 
  
  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
  
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your 
  school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if 
  necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

              (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2) separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.
               
        2.2. Contributor Grant.
        Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license

              (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of  Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination).
  
              (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Covered Code.

  3. Distribution Obligations.
  
        3.1. Application of License.
        The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.
  
        3.2. Availability of Source Code.
        Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
  
        3.3. Description of Modifications.
        You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
  
        3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
              (a) Third Party Claims.
              If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
  
              (b) Contributor APIs.
              If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.
               
                  (c)    Representations.
              Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
  
  
        3.5. Required Notices.
        You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
  
        3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
        You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
  
        3.7. Larger Works.
        You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
  
  4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
  
        If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
  
  5. Application of this License.
  
        This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
  
  6. Versions of the License.
  
        6.1. New Versions.
        Netscape Communications Corporation (''Netscape'') may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
  
        6.2. Effect of New Versions.
        Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.
  
        6.3. Derivative Works.
        If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ''Mozilla'', ''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'', ''Netscape'', "MPL", ''NPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)
  
  7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
  
        COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
  
  8. TERMINATION.
  
        8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.
  
        8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:
  
        (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)  agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.
  
        (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.
  
        8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.
  
        8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,  all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.
  
  9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
  
        UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
  
  10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
  
        The Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ''commercial computer software'' and ''commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.
  
  11. MISCELLANEOUS.
  
        This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
  
  12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
  
        As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
  
  13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
  
        Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as Multiple-Licensed.  Multiple-Licensed means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

      (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or 
      trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce, modify, display,

      the Original Code with other software or devices, including but not limited to 

      Modifications. 

3.0 DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS 

3.1 Application of License. 


The Source Code version of Original Code may be distributed only under 
the terms of this License or a future version of this License released 
under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every 
copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any 
terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable 
version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. Your license 
for shipment of the Contributor Version is conditioned upon Your full compliance 

with this Section. The Modifications which You create must comply with 
all requirements set out by the Standards body in effect one hundred twenty 
(120) days before You ship the Contributor Version. In the event that the 
Modifications do not meet such requirements, You agree to publish either 
(i) any deviation from the Standards protocol resulting from implementation 
of Your Modifications and a reference implementation of Your Modifications 
or (ii) Your Modifications in Source Code form, and to make any such deviation

under the same terms as this license on a royalty free basis within thirty 
(30) days of Your first customer shipment of Your Modifications. 

3.2 Required Notices. 


You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the 
Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source 
Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a 
location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to 
look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You 
may add Your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit 
A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the 
Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating 
to Initial Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, 
support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of 
Your version of the Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf,

is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial 
Developer for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer as a result 
of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable or 
Source versions, related documentation or collateral in which You describe 
recipients' rights relating to the Original Code. You may distribute the

code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger 
Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements 
of this License are fulfilled for the Original Code. 

4.0 INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION

License with respect to some or all of the Original Code due to statute, 
judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms 
of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations 

and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL 
file described in Section 3.2 and must be included with all distributions 
of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, 
such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary 
skill to be able to understand it.

such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses 
to the Original Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination 
of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect 
beyond the termination of this License shall survive. 

8.2 In the event of termination under Section 8.1 above, all 
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which 
have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to 
termination shall survive termination. 

9.0 LIMIT OF LIABILITY 

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING 
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, 
ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF ORIGINAL CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER 
OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, 
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT 
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE 
OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN 
IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR 
PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE 
LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION 
OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION 
AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 

10.0 U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS 

U.S. Government: If this Software is being acquired by or on behalf 
of the U.S. Government or by a U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor

                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2.1, February 1999

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Lesser General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!

                   GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.
