Welcome to JDS Development!

This is the source code for the Java Desktop System, JDS. Take some time to read
through the various pieces of documentation that are available at 
http://www.opensolaris.org/os/project/jds that will give you some information
on a wide range of topics, including the bug lifecycle and review process, 
development guidelines and rationales, and new tasks being worked on. There 
are also a number of documents available in the 'docs' directory about specific 
elements of the packaging to be aware of.
