The package prototypes in this directory are for reference only, they
are not used during the build process.  You can use them to verify if
the packages you build have the same contents as the official JDS builds.
To do so, simply diff(1) your dynamically generated prototype found in
$cbe_prefix/packages/PKGMAPS/proto/SUNWsome-package.proto with the one
in the subdirectory matching your platform.
