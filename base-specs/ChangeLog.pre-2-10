	Install icons into the hicolor icon directory, so that we don't
	have to sync the icons with the packages they originally came
	from. This should probably be fixed better in the code to use
	GtkIconTheme, but for now, this is probably more effective.

	the theme. The correct fix should be installing these icons
	to the 'hicolor' or 'gnome' theme in the panel sources, which
	I'll magically do in the next commit. Also has the benefit
	of keeping the launch menu button in sync with the blueprint/
	gnome-panel work that Erwann is doing.

2004-11-24  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* patches/gnome-vfs-09-system-settings-uri.diff: Okay, this is a 
	hack. I don't know what is going on here with the vfolder code, but
	I'm kinda hesitant to do proper research for it. For now, move all
	the YaST2 items into /usr/share/applications/system-settings. For
	some reason [probably bugs in the vfolder code], it doesn't like
	being dumped into /usr/share/applications with the rest of the
	.desktop files. For 2.10, thankfully we'll have a new menu system
	which will actually work. Again, this fixes stopper bugs -
	#5109266, #6197855, #6197854 and others that Shane didn't want to
	open.

	using a stock icon for the window icon. Not quite sure why this

	in the gtk_widget_render_icon seems to do the trick - remember
	Brian patching something to do with this upstream in GTK+, but not
	much more. Fixes #6195748.

	* gdm.spec, patches/gdm-25-greenline.diff,
	  ext-sources/gdm2-login.xml:  Added patch
	  25 for GreenLine support.  THe problem with disabling
	  core dumps in the GreenLine XML file is that this
	  causes GreenLine to ignore core dumps for all programs
	  including gdm.  Now using patch 25 we use ctrun to
	  specify that only programs launched from gdm's Xsession
	  script (the user's session) are run in a separate
	  GreenLine contract that ignores core dumps.  This way
	  if gdm itself core dumps, GreenLine will correctly
	  default back to console login.

2004-03-22  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gtk2.spec, patches/gtk+-07-mediaLib.diff:  Add mediaLib support for
	  Solaris.  The configure script checks for the availability of
	  mediaLib, so this patch will work with the Linux build.  Updated the
	  spec file so that it calls autoconf/automake since rebuilding the
	  configure script is necessary for identifying if mediaLib is present,
	  and the patch modifies a Makefile.am file.

2004-03-18  Brian Cameron <brian.cameron@sun.com>

    * patches/gdm-08-fix-gdmtranslate.diff, patches/gdm-09-fix-which.diff,
      patches/gdm-10-xdmcp-enable.diff:  Patch 08 allows gdm to be compiled
      with -g, patch 09 corrects various gdm scripts to use shell commands
      to find executables in the PATH rather than using the 'which' command,
      since the which command doesn't work on Solaris without an associated
      TTY.  Patch 10 turns on XDMCP by default.
    * gdm.spec: Turned off IPv6 support since a bug in that logic causes
      the chooser to not work (see bugzilla bug 133246).  This should be
      reversed after this bug is fixed by Wipro.

	  to correct Solaris-specific bug caused by the fact that on
	  Solaris a -1 enum is treated as -1 while on Linux it is
	  treated as (2^32)-1.  Without this patch the gnome-panel and
	  gdm were crashing.

2004-03-16 Erwann Chenede - <erwann.chenede@sun.com>

	* patches/gnome-panel-06-i18n-launch-button.diff:

2004-03-16  Padraig O'Briain <padraig.obriain@sun.com>

2004-03-12 Ghee Teo  <ghee.teo@sun.com>

	* Dropping the iconlist-dialog patch and goes for the HEAD. The
	  patch libgnomeprintui-02-iconlist-dialog.diff was the ximian's
 	  patch that give a icon list of printers instead of use of menu list.
	  With the new changes in the HEAD, the iconlist dialog looks really
	  ugly.  Using the HEAD solves 2 problems, the iconlist-dialog patch 
	  does not work well with the currect HEAD code and it looks pretty 
	  ugly and also one less patch to maintain. But Will review this with 
	  HCI before final feature freeze and before I purge the iconlist
	  dialog from the CVS.  I am keeping the other 2 patches in CVS for 
 	  the time being in case I need to revert. But certainly have rename
	  what was libgnomeprint-03-in-nautilus.diff now to
	  libgnomeprint-02-in-nautilus.diff.
	 
	  [ I hope these updated jarbages makes some sense to the Gate Master ].

	  Some newer components eg. control-center >= 2.5.3 are not
	  building due to the standard versions of automake being too
	  old. These tools are installed under /opt/jds/bin and newer
	  versions of gnome components can use these tools where necessary.
	  See control-center.spec for info.
	* control-center.spec: Add BuildRequires flags for the jds autotools
	  and prefix PATH to /opt/jds/bin on linux.
	  Apply forte build patch on solaris only.

2004-01-06  Niall Power <niall.power@sun.com>

	* gnome-vfs.spec: Correct last Changelog entry, since it's
	  now 2004, not 2003. Doh.

2004-01-05  Ghee Teo <ghee.teo@sun.com>

	* Removed -%{majorminor} from gst-register because as a distro we 
	  do not need a parallel installed version of the program. That is, 
	  we should only have one version of the program only.

2004-01-05  Niall Power <niall.power@sun.com>
	                                                                        
	* gnome-vfs.spec: bump release to 2.5.4.1 and  fix broken build.
	* patches/gnome-vfs-03-nfs-module.diff: make patch apply to
	  new tarball.

2004-01-05  Ghee Teo <ghee.teo@sun.com>

	* Fixed the postinstall problem. Basically, gst has allowed for 
	  parallel installed and had decided to have program named by 
 	  /usr/bin/gst-regsiter-<majorminor> since we do not deliver multiple 
	  versions on our distro, so configure with --program-suffix="" to 
	  remove the version number.

2003-12-24  Laszlo Peter  <laca@sun.com>

	* merge man pages from mercury-se to stop the build errors.

2003-12-17  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	Not sure how I should be approaching this, since it should really
	be parallel installable with gstreamer-0.6, probably should be 
	called something different perhaps.

	We should not have changes to the public API in a tarball, unless
	we're 100% sure that we get get these changed upstream in the future.
	I don't think this is currently happening, hence why I didn't try
	to merge them in the sources.
