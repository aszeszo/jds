# This patch disables GOOM since it crashes if you build it with SS11.  The
# code builds and works fine with SS12.  Note that we were having some
# crashing issues with this code built with SS12, but the Sun Studio team
# helped to identify how to fix this bug (see CR #6941813, bugzilla #615998)
# and that patch has gone upstream.

%description
GStreamer is a streaming-media framework, based on graphs of filters which
operate on media data. Applications using this library can do anything
from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just about anything
else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means that new data
types or processing capabilities can be added simply by installing new
plug-ins.

  which is no longer useful. Renumbering opendeviceonce.diff 
  and cdda.diff.
* Wed Mar 21 2007 - damien.carbery@sun.com

  head.
* Mon Dec 11 2006 - brian.cameron@sun.com

  CVS head.  This fixes all these issues and the performance issues
  we have been seeing with GStreamer on Solaris.
* Mon Nov 27 2006 - brian.cameron@sun.com
- Patch to rest function so that on close we flush the input/output
  buffer.  This makes pause/stopping a file much more responsive.
* Fri Nov  3 2006 - laca@sun.com
- use %gtk_doc_option in configure so that it can be disabled using
  --without-gtk-doc.
* Tue Oct 17 2006 - damien.carbery@sun.com
- Remove code that deletes *.a and *.la from %{_libdir} as none are installed 
  there.
* Mon Oct 16 2006 - damien.carbery@sun.com
- Remove the '-f' from the 'rm *.la *.a' lines so that any changes to the
  module source will be seen as a build error and action can be taken.
* Mon Sep 11 2006 - brian.cameron@sun.com
- Bump to 0.10.4.
* Thu Jul 27 2006 - brian.cameron@sun.com
- Fix src plugin so it opens nonblocking with the
  gst-plugins-good-09-srcopen.diff patch.
* Fri Jul 21 2006 - brian.cameron@sun.com
- Fix CDDA plugin so it doesn't assert & core dump if the CD device
  is not found.
* Thu Jun 29 2006 - brian.cameron@sun.com
- Move monitor to "source" tab, so it is more like sdtaudiocontrol.
  done via patch gst-plugins-good-07-monitorinput.diff.
* Tue Jun 27 2006 - brian.cameron@sun.com
- Fix sink plugin so it does not always reset port in prepare.  If the
  user has turned off the built-in speaker port in sdtaudiocontrol
  (or otherwise), then turning it back on causes the speakers to
  turn back on each time the user changes a track in rhythmbox, totem,
  etc.
* Thu Jun 15 2006 - brian.cameron@sun.com
- Now mute works with input tracks, and setting mute in the panel
  applet and gnome-volume-control doesn't get out-of-sync.
* Wed Jun 14 2006 - brian.cameron@sun.com
- Add patches to fix mixer and add source plugin.
* Tue Jun 13 2006 - brian.cameron@sun.com
- Bump to 0.10.3.
* Tue Jun 06 2006 - brian.cameron@sun.com
- Add patch gst-plugins-good-03-fixmixer.diff so that the mixer no
  longer core dumps if you check/uncheck the choices in 
  gnome-volume-control preferences.  Fix so mute works in
  gnome-volume-control, and fix so that setting the volume isn't
  hardcoded to only work with the audio output track.
* Wed May 10 2006 - brian.cameron@sun.com
- Remove gst-visualize again, this got lost when we migrated from
  gst-plugins to gst-plugins-base.
* Wed Apr 05 2006 - brian.cameron@sun.com
- Add patch 2 to fix the sunaudiosink so it allocates the ringbuffer 
  properly instead of using buffer-time property.  This fix should be
  in the next release of gst-plugins-good and can be removed at that
  time.
* Wed Feb 15 2006 - damien.carbery@sun.com
- Bump to 0.10.2.
- Remove upstream patches, 02-fixconfig, 03-fixsunaudio.
* Mon Feb 13 2006 - damien.carbery@sun.com
- Add hack to fix infinite loop problem in po/Makefile.
* Mon Jan 9 2006 - brian.cameron@sun.com
- Update to 0.10.0.  This file was copied from the old gst-plugins.spec file
  and modified to work with gst-plugins-good.  The Obsoletes, Provides and
  packaging sections will need work if someone wants to build this
  on Linux.
* Mon Sep 26 2005 - brian.cameron@sun.com
- Add patch 2 which defines "inline" functions as either
  "static inline" or "extern inline".  Just defining
  functions as "inline" breaks Forte.
* Tue Sep 20 2005 - brian.cameron@sun.com
- Bump to 0.8.11.
* Mon Aug 15 2005 - damien.carbery@sun.com
- Bump to 0.8.10.

- Enable building of musicbrainz plugin.
* Fri Jul 01 2005 - matt.keenan@sun.com
- Added patch 02-pkgconfig.diff, for Solairs build with new pkg-config.
* Mon Jun 06 2005 - brian.cameron@sun.com
- Removed patch for modifying uninstalled-pc file since it is no longer
  needed.
* Fri Jun 03 2005 - brian.cameron@sun.com
- Add autodetect, equalizer, games, librfb, subparse, tta plugins which
  are new to 2.8.8.
* Fri May 13 2005 - brian.cameron@sun.com
- For the previous version of GStreamer, we were copying in a few files
  to fix GPL headers.  Took out this since it isn't needed and was
  breaking the build.
* Tue Mar 15 2005 - balamurali.viswanathan@wipro.com
- Add patch gst-plugins-13-query-position-osssrc.diff to fix bug #6238742
  Patch taken from HEAD.

- Add patch 07 to add an source element to sunaudio plugin.
* Mon Aug 30 2004 - takao.fujiwara@sun.com
- Update gst-plugins-02-g11n-potfiles.diff.
* Thu Aug 26 2004 - brian.cameron@sun.com
- No longer delete gstffmpegcolorspace since totem will not work without it.
  It does not use any MPEG licensed logic (ffmpeg refers to the ffmpeg
  module not MPEG).  Also don't delete libgstaasink.so since we never
  install it anyway with --disable-aalib.
* Thu Aug 26 2004 - ghee.teo@sun.com
- Obsoleted external plugin module, colorspace, asf and avi.
  These are now bundled into gstreamer-plugins.

* Wed Aug 11 2004 - brian.cameron@sun.com

  disabled, added --with-plugins to disable the proper gst

- Updated to 0.8.3.
* Thu Jul 29 2004 - brian.cameron@sun.com
- Updated to gst-plugins 0.8.2, making patches 1, 4, 5, and 8 go
  away since they were integrated into CVS head.  Fixed libtoolize
  call so it works for Solaris.  Added patch 6 to make wavparse work,
  and this patch will go away when we upgrade to gst-plugins 0.8.3.
* Fri Jul 16 2004 - brian.cameron@sun.com

* Wed May 12 2004 - laca@sun.com
- jds-autotoolize.
- change order of directories in the aclocal call so that the correct vorbis
  macro is picked up. The one that comes with SuSE appears to be broken.

- require gstreamer >= 0.8.0.
* Fri Apr 16 2004 - brian.cameron@sun.com

  until I figure out why .so files aren't being built.
