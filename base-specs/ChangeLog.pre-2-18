	  of /etc/fstab.  So any users wanting to build libgphoto without HAL
	  will need to look into re-adding some of this patch.

	  modify SUNWgnome-remote-desktop.spec according this change.

2006-09-19 Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gnome-desktop.spec: Build gnome-about release version using
	  the %{version} value rather than hardcoding it so we don't
	  always have to change this for each release.

2006-09-19 Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* patches/gnome-volume-manager-04-fixlocaluser.diff:  After 
	  talking with Artem, the previous patch also wasn't a good
	  fix.  Seems on some machine utmp->ut_line could be "console"
	  instead of "tty", and this wouldn't work on Sun Ray.  Better
	  to avoid this hacky test on Solaris.

2006-09-19 Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gnome-volume-manager.spec,
	  patches/gnome-volume-manager-04-fixlocaluser.diff:  Fix problem

2006-09-18  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* nautilus-cd-burner.spec,
	  patches/nautilus-cd-burner-05-solarishal.diff: Add back patch to
	  make sound-juicer work with Solaris HAL where we use the raw device
	  name rather than the device name normally used on Linux.  This patch
	  was in 2.14 but got lost when the underlying code changed.

2006-09-18  Laszlo (Laca) Peter  <laca@sun.com>

	Python 64-bit changes, mostly from John.Levon.

	* patches/Python-01-solaris-lib-dirs.diff: (update) merge for 2.4.3
	  and fix ssl libdir part so that it uses a 64-bit libdir when built
	  in 64-bit mode
	* patches/Python-02-pycc.diff: (update) reset IFS correctly;
	  use = not ==; add some hacks at the bottom to use the right
	  gcc options, so 64-bit can build
	* patches/Python-03-distutils-pycc.diff: force using pycc/pyCC
	  so that CC/CXX/FLAGS/LDFLAGS are picked up from the environment
	* patches/Python-04-distutils-log.diff: fix log.info commands so
	  that they work when the '%' char appears in a compiler flags
	* patches/Python-05-isalibs.diff: (new) make .so's be generated as
	  foo.so, 64/foo.so; some really nasty fixes to pyconfig.h: we
	  cannot use the compile-time version of SIZEOF, so we hack them
	  in using _LP64. We use PY_CHECK_SIZEOF to avoid autoconf
	  automatically adding them to pyconfig.h; in the Makefile, make
	  python obey libdir for libpython, but still put the generic stuff
	  in /usr/lib/python2.4 (not /usr/lib/amd64/python2.4...)

2006-09-18  Matt Keenan  <matt.keenan@sun.com>

	* yelp.spec : Add patch to fix bug 6471853 / 318996, NULL check on
	  variable before doing a strcmp.

	  that is no longer needed.
	* gnome-applets.spec,
	  patches/gnome-applets-02-mini-commander-tooltip.diff:  We no longer
	  ship mini-commander - no need to patch it anymore.
	* patches/gnome-applets-06-multiload-Xau.diff: Patch was only needed
	  if building applets against build 48 of libgtop since libgtop used
	  to include -lXau.  It no longer does, so simply rebuilding libgtop
	  and rebuilding gnome-applets works better if you run into this
	  problem.

2006-09-15  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* control-center.spec, patches/control-center-12-background-crash.diff:
	  Verified that this patch is no longer needed, so removed and
	  renmaed the other control center patches.

2006-09-15  Darren Kenny <darren.kenny@sun.com>

	* gst-plugins-good.spec, patches/gst-plugins-good-04-master.diff:
	  Add flag to Output Track to say it's the MASTER track (since it's the
	  only output track it must be).
	* control-center.spec:
	  Removed the volume-control patch since we have made fix to GStreamer to
	  flag the MASTER track, which is used for controling the volume.
	  Fix for Bug#6442357
	* patches/control-center-09-volume-control.diff:
	  Removed.

	  Resynced numbering due to patch 09 removal.

2006-09-15  Matt Keenan <matt.keenan@sun.com>

	* nautilus-16-interface-changes.spec : Bug: 6470306 : Another situation
	  where patch applied yet patch was incorrect, incorrect pointer being
	  passed to internal function add_place(), internal function interface

	  contains the table and the checkboxes.  This avoids

2006-08-02  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* ORBit2.spec, ext-sources/orbitrc, patches/ORBit-05-localonly.diff:
	  Turn on ORBLocalOnly=1 in /etc/orbitrc.  This is needed to resolve
	  P1 security bug 6440951.  This change is required by the "Secure
	  By Default" team to ensure that JDS not leave TCP/IP ports listening
	  to the network by default.  This patch ensures that only local
	  TCP/IP connections are accepted by default.

	  The patch for ORBit2 is to fix a bug that was causing ORBLocalOnly
	  mode to not work on Solaris.  There seems to be a problem with 
	  getaddrinfo() working on Solaris, so this patches makes sure that
	  HAVE_GETADDRINFO is unset so the fallback gethostbyname() gets used,
	  which seems to work better.  The problem with the getaddrinfo() 
	  comparison seems to be that doing memcmp() on sockaddr_in structures
	  is not a good way to test if the structures contain the same IP on
	  Solaris.  If we find ORBLocalOnly fails to work in some situations,
	  it would be worth checking to see if fixing the gethostbyname()
	  comparison to work makes a difference.

2006-08-02  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

2006-07-07  Dave Lin  <dave.lin@sun.com>

	* firefox.spec: enable the patch firefox-15-no-nss-nspr.diff

2006-06-30  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gst-plugins-good.spec, gnome-media.spec, 
	  patches/gnome-media-07-supportdevices.diff, 
	  patches/gst-plugins-good-07-monitorinput.diff:  Improve the
	  gnome-volume-control program so that you can specify which 
	  input/output ports to use, so now gnome-volume-control is
	  as functional as sdtaudiocontrol.  The gnome-media patch is
	  a bit of a hack, since it would obviously be better if all
	  interactions with the SunAudio interfaces were encapsulated in
	  the GStreamer mixer plugin.  But, for now, the mixer interfaces
	  does not let you get/set flags.  This is a known issue, and
	  if/when GStreamer is enhanced to support this, then this patch
	  should go away and that mechanism used.

2006-06-30  Stephen Browne  <stephen.browne@sun.com>

	  -c <class> assigns the job to a class, useful for postrun-query.
	  The -i option tells postrun to ignore the job if it cannot be
	  executed immediately.  This is useful for %preun script that
	  cannot successfully complete once the pkg is uninstalled.

2006-06-29  Laszlo (Laca) Peter  <laca@sun.com>

	* GConf.spec: add patch GCONF_BACKEND_DIR

	* gst-plugins-good.spec, patches/gst-plugins-good-06-fixplay.diff:
	  Fix sink plugin so it does not always reset port in prepare.  If
	  the user has turned off the built-in speaker port in
	  sdtaudiocontrol (or otherwise), then turning it back on causes
	  the speakers to turn back on each time the user changes a track
	  in rhythmbox, totem, etc.

2006-06-27  Yuriy Kuznetsov <yuriy.kuznetsov@sun.com>

	  when using the visualizer in totem.  Thanks to James Cheng for
	  pointing this out.

2006-01-25  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* aspell.spec, patches/aspell-01-forte.diff:  Damien asked me to 
	  look into why aspell wasn't compiling.  My C++ skills are a bit
	  rusty, so it took me a while to get this working.  First, I 
	  noticed that the changes in the previous aspell-01-forte.diff
	  patch are no longer necessary (not sure if this is because the
	  latest version of Forte is smarter or if the newer aspell release
	  corrected those issues).  The new patch is a completely different
	  patch that resolves the Forte compile issues.  I added
	  --disable-wide-curses to the aspell configure on Solaris since
	  wide-curses generates a lot of compile problems that I don't
	  think can be resolved.  Although configure thinks Solaris supports
	  wide curses, the Solaris header files do not have a lot of the
	  #defines and functions that aspell needs to build with this.
	* ext-sources/registry-i386.xml, ext-sources/registry-sparc.xml:
	  Removed these files.  GStreamer 0.10 no longer uses registry files,
	  instead it now figures out what plugins are available dynamically
	  when needed.  So these files are no longer needed or installed.

	* MAINTAINERS: Blank over for now, since the concept of maintainers

	* *.spec: add/fix sun copyright at top; set distribution to
	  "Java Desktop System" (without release number or code name);
	  add many Prereq's; fix some Source URLs; 

2005-08-05  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* GConf.spec, ORBit2.spec, gcalctool.spec, gconf-editor.spec,

2005-08-05  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* bootsplash-theme-Sun.spec: Remove, since it doesn't quite
	make sense on Solaris right now. It's on a branch anyway if 
	we need it again. I'm sure I'm going to get flamed tomorrow
	morning when I wake up.

2005-08-05  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* sun-system-settings.spec: Remove since this was mostly
	YaST specific stuff.

2005-08-05  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* README: Add, needs work.

2005-08-05  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* SUN_adjustments: Remove, we don't need this anymore.

2005-08-05  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* suse-fixups.sh, * suse-fixups/*: Remove these. They're on a
	branch if we need them.

2005-08-05  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* ext-sources/gnome-splash-linux.png: Remove.
	* ext-sources/gnome-splash.png: Update from above. We only have
	one splash now.
	* gnome-session.spec: Update.
	* patches/gnome-session-02-splash-logos-linux.diff: Remove, let's
	focus on a single splash screen for the moment. We can get it from
	the branch if we need it again.

2005-08-05  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* ext-sources/installation.en_*,
	yast2-*.spec: Wahoo! Remove all this stuff. I feel so good doing 
	this.

2005-08-05  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* libtool.spec, patches/libtool-1.5.18-multilib.patch: Remove, since
	these are part of the CBE.

2005-08-05  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* patches/vino-X-fix-stdint.diff: Remove, we don't currently
	build on Solaris, but if we do, we may need to bring back.

2005-08-05  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* patches/nautilus-X-add-network-place.diff,

	* patches/nautilus-X-printing.diff,
	* patches/nautilus-X-unescape-filename-to-print.diff,
	* patches/nautilus-X-use-default-action-for-files.diff: Okay,
	remove a slew of patches. We're removing the network places stuff
	to get aligned with the community on that. Removing the extra
	printing stuff, since nautilus no longer supports components
	and the file print stuff was just inconsistant, and didn't support
	anything more than just gs, and staroffice. It should use nautilus
	extensions instead if anything. Broken!

2005-08-05  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* patches/gnome-vfs-X-ignore-rootfs.diff,
	* patches/gnome-vfs-X-network-places.diff: Remove the subfs stuff
	in gnome-vfs, since we don't really care about it so much anymore
	[it's on a branch if needed to revive]. We're moving towards the
	community version of the computer and network places dialog, so
	remove that patch too. Naren has volunteered to do the rest of the
	work on this.

2005-08-05  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* ext-sources/warped.png: Remove - it should be in the 
	sun-backgrounds tarball in gnome-backgrounds.spec if anything.

2005-08-05  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* gnome-games.spec,
	patches/gnome-games-05-g11n-desktop-fix.diff,
	patches/gnome-games-X-hig-fixes.diff: Update. Remove the g11n patch
	since it's wrong anyway. Remove the easter egg - we can do a better
	job at this and be more inclusive. I think it should be the first
	developer task on opensolaris.org. The trigger is still in nautilus -
	we may want to remove that at some stage.

2005-08-05  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* gnome-applets.spec, 
	patches/gnome-applets-X-disable-gswitchit-solaris.diff,

	patches/gnome-applets-X-powersaved-support-for-battstat.diff: Update,
	removing these patches. the powersaved one is already ported. There is
	no longer a fallback to GKB, so remove this patch.

2005-08-05  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* bug-buddy.spec, patches/bug-buddy-X-bug-reporting.diff: Fix up 
	spec file, and drop the branding patch. We don't even ship bug-buddy
	with Solaris, so we might as well remove the branding patch for
	opensolaris.org.

2005-08-04  Laszlo Peter  <laca@sun.com>

	* gnome-vfs.spec: add patch18 (nocopy.diff) for bugzilla bug 311591,

	* gnome-applets.spec: No longer call javahelp-convert-install
