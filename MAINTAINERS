If you are interested in contributing to JDS development, please log bugs
in http://bugs.opensolaris.org/ and send patches to desktop-discuss@opensolaris.org.

Each spec file is currently maintained separately by a series of component 
owners as indicated by the 'Owner:' field. They are responsible for the 
general well being of the module, making sure that all patches apply 
cleanly, extra sources are needed, and the spec file conforms to the 
various review guidelines that have been set. If you are interested in
co-owning some of these spec files, contact the appropriate existing
owners.
